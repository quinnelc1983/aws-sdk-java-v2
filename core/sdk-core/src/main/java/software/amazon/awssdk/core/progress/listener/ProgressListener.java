/**
 * The {@link ProgressListener} interface may be implemented by your application in order to receive event-driven updates on
 * the progress of a service call. When you construct an {@link PutObjectRequest} or {@link
 * UploadPartRequest} request submitted to the Sdk, you may provide a variable number of {@link
 * ProgressListener}s to be associated with that request. Then, throughout the lifecycle of the request,
 * the Sdk
 * will invoke the provided {@link ProgressListener}s when important events occur, like additional bytes being transferred,
 * allowing you to monitor the ongoing progress of the transaction.
 * <p>
 * Each {@link ProgressListener} callback is invoked with an immutable {@link Context} object. Depending on the current
 * lifecycle
 * of the request, different {@link Context} objects have different attributes available (indicated by the provided context
 * interface). Most notably, every callback is given access to the current {@link ProgressSnapshot}, which contains
 * helpful progress-related methods like {@link ProgressSnapshot#transferredBytes()} and {@link
 * ProgressSnapshot#ratioTransferred()}.
 * <p>
 * A successful transfer callback lifecycle is sequenced as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link #requestPrepared(Context.RequestPrepared)} - A new Request has been initiated. This method is called
 *     exactly once per transfer.</li>
 *     <ul>Available context attributes:
 *         <li>{@link Context.RequestPrepared#request()}</li>
 *         <li>{@link Context.RequestPrepared#progressSnapshot()}</li>
 *     </ul>
 *     <li>{@link #requestBytesSent(Context.RequestBytesSent)} - Additional bytes have been sent. This
 *     method may be called many times per request, depending on the request payload size and I/O buffer sizes.
 *     <li>{@link #responseBytesReceived(Context.ResponseBytesReceived)} - Additional bytes have been received. This
 *     method may be called many times per request, depending on the response payload size and I/O buffer sizes.
 *     <li>{@link #executionSuccess(Context.ExecutionSuccess)} - The transfer has completed successfully. This method is called
 *     exactly once for a successful transfer.</li>
 * </ol>
 * For every failed attempt {@link #attemptFailure(Context.AttemptFailure)}  will be called exactly once.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are a few important rules and best practices that govern the usage of {@link ProgressListener}s:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link ProgressListener} implementations should not block, sleep, or otherwise delay the calling thread. If you need
 *     to perform blocking operations, you should schedule them in a separate thread or executor that you control.</li>
 *     <li>Be mindful that {@link #requestBytesSent(Context.RequestBytesSent)} or
 *     {@link #responseBytesReceived(Context.ResponseBytesReceived)}
 *     may be called extremely often for large payloads
 *     (subject to I/O buffer sizes). Be careful in implementing expensive operations as a side effect. Consider rate-limiting
 *     your side effect operations, if needed.</li>
 *     <li>{@link ProgressListener}s may be invoked by different threads. If your {@link ProgressListener} is stateful,
 *     ensure that it is also thread-safe.</li>
 *     <li>{@link ProgressListener}s are not intended to be used for control flow, and therefore your implementation
 *     should not <i>throw</i>. Any thrown exceptions will be suppressed and logged as an error.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A classical use case of {@link ProgressListener} is to create a progress bar to monitor an ongoing transfer's progress.
 * Refer to the implementation of {@link LoggingProgressListener} for a basic example, or test it in your application by providing
 * the listener as part of your {@link SdkHttpRequest}. E.g.,
 * <pre>{@code
 * AmazonS3Client s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(awsCredentials);
 * PutObjectRequest putObjectRequest = PutObjectRequest.builder()
 *                                        .bucket("bucket")
 *                                        .key("key")
 *                                        .overrideConfiguration(o -> o.addProgressListener(LoggingTransferListener.create())
 *                                        .build();
 * s3Client.putObject(putObjectRequest);
 * }</pre>
 * And then a successful transfer may output something similar to:
 * <pre>
 * Request initiated...
 * |                    | 0.0%
 * |==                  | 12.5%
 * |=====               | 25.0%
 * |=======             | 37.5%
 * |==========          | 50.0%
 * |============        | 62.5%
 * |===============     | 75.0%
 * |=================   | 87.5%
 * |====================| 100.0%
 * Request execution successful!
 * </pre>
